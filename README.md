# <ins> Hospital Emergency Room Dashboard-Power BI </ins>
Committed to delivering high-quality patient care and improving emergency response efficiency.

## Project Description
"Developed real-time hospital emergency room dashboards using Power BI to track patient flow, wait times, and resource utilization. Improved data-driven decision-making for hospital administrators."

## Skills
- Data Visulazation
- DAX

## Requirements & KPI's
To enhance operational efficiency and provide actionable insights into emergency room performance, we need to create a Hospital Emergency Room Analysis Dashboard in Power BI. This solution will enable stakeholders to track, analysis, and make data-driven decisions regarding patient management and service optimization.

1. Number Of Patients:
 - Measure the total number of patients visiting the ER daily.
 - Display a daily trend using an area sparkline to understand patterns over time, such as peak days or seasonal trends.

2. Average Wait Time:
 - Calculate the average time patients wait before being attended tp by a medical professional.
 - Use an area sparkline to show daily fluctuations and identify days with higher wait times that may require operational adjustments.

3. Patient Satisfaction Score:
 - Analyze the average satisfaction score of patients on a daily basis to evalute the quality of service provided.
 - Present a daily trend using an area sparkline to identify dips in satisfaction and correlate the with operational challenges or peak times.

4. Number of Patients Referred:
 - Count the number of patients referred to specific departments from the ER each day.
 - Use an area sparkline to track daily trends and identify departments with high referral rates, which may require additional resources.

# Dashboard-1. <ins>Monthly View</ins>
Objective: Monitor key metrics and trends on a month-by-month basis to identify patterns and areas for improvement.

## Chart to Develop:
- Patient Admission Status: Track admitted vs. non-admitted patients.
- Patient Age Distribution:Group patients by 10-year age intervals.
- Department Referrals:Analyze referral trends across different departments.
- Timeliness:Measure the percentage of patients seen within 30 minutes.- .Gender Analysis: Visualize patient distribution by gender.
- Racial Demographics: Analyze patient data by race.
- Time Analysis:Assess patient volume by day and hour.
